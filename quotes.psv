I Feel Like My Life Is Just A Series Of Unrelated Wacky Adventures.  |  Bojack Horseman   |  S00E00
I Need To Go Take A Shower So I Can’t Tell If I’m Crying Or Not. |  Bojack Horseman   |  S00E00
Ow, crap. I hate this. Running is terrible. Everything is the worst. |  Bojack Horseman   |  S00E00
The universe is a cruel, uncaring void. The key to being happy isn’t the search for meaning; it’s just to keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense, and eventually, you’ll be dead.  |  Mr. Peanutbutter  |  S00E00
I’m responsible for my own happiness? I can’t even be responsible for my own breakfast!  |  Bojack Horseman  |   S01E01
I don’t understand how people… live. It’s amazing to me that people wake up every morning and say: ‘Yeah, another day, let’s do it.’ How do people do it? I don’t know how.  |  Bojack Horseman  |   S02E12
I Need To Go Take A Shower So I Can’t Tell If I’m Crying Or Not. | Bojack Horseman | S00E00
No, I don't think I should drive right now. I'm-I'm incredibly drunk. | Bojack Horseman | S01E01
You sleep on my couch and you don't pay rent. I've had tapeworms that are less parasitic. I don't even remember why I let you stay with me in the first place. | Bojack Horseman | S01E01
I don't know how you expect me to love you when you so clearly hate yourself. | Princess Carolyn | S01E01
You look like a pile of crap ate a second pile of crap and then crapped out a third pile of crap. | Princess Carolyn | S01E01
So, are you available for Tuesday, or are you gonna be too busy masturbating to old pictures of yourself? | Princess Carolyn | S01E01
Most people don't even get to do The Brady Bunch version of the thing they want to do with their lives. You're actually in a really good position now, because you can pretty much do anything you want. You're responsible for your own happiness, you know? | Diane Nguyen | S01E01
I just wanted you to know that you ruined someone else's night tonight. And I hope you have enough decency to at least feel a little bit crappy about it. | Bojack Horseman | S01E02
I was actually already in a bad mood but I thought maybe for one night, I could go out to a bar and try to forget about myself. But now because of you and your friends, I feel more self-conscious than ever. | Bojack Horseman | S01E02
Maybe because you're skinny and maybe 'cause you're pretty, you're used to getting away with things! But I want you to know that your actions have an effect on others, and I hate you! And you are a horrible person! And you not understanding that you're a horrible person doesn't make you less of a horrible person. | Bojack Horseman | S01E02
This is classic Hollywood elitism. BoJack Horseman thinks that because he was on TV, that makes him better than everybody. Well, guess what, BoJack! Now I'm on TV! So now I'm better than everybody! | Neal the Navy Seal | S01E02
Yes, I ate all the muffins, because I have no self-control and I hate myself. | Bojack Horseman | S01E02
Maybe some of the troops are heroes, but not automatically. I'm sure a lot of the troops are jerks. Most people are jerks already, and it's not like giving a jerk a gun and telling him it's okay to kill people suddenly turns that jerk into a hero. | Bojack Horseman | S01E02
And I don't believe saying that cheapens the word and actually disrespects those we mean to honor by turning real people into political pawns. Also, I am not deeply ambivalent about a seemingly mandated celebration of our military by a nation that claims to value peace telling our children that violence is never the answer while refusing to hold our own government to the same standard. Furthermore, I do not find it unbelievably appropriate that this conversation is taking place on reality television, a genre which thrives on chopping the complexities of our era into easily digestible chunks of empty catchphrases. | Bojack Horseman | S01E02
You know what the problem is with everybody? They all just want to hear what they already believe. No one ever wants to hear the truth. | Bojack Horseman | S01E02
The most important thing is, you got to give the people what they want, even if it kills you, even if it empties you out until there's nothing left to empty. No matter what happens, no matter how much it hurts, you don't stop dancing, and you don't stop smiling, and you give those people what they want. | Bojack Horseman | S01E03
Oh, come on! I mean, am I attracted to her? Sure. Do my days feel better when I'm around her? Yeah. Does she get me in ways no woman ever has? Indubitably. Do I fantasize about her? Yes, but only in two positions. Look, am I the kind of guy who would try to steal someone else's girlfriend? Sure, of course, but do I like her? The answer's no. You have nothing to worry about. | Bojack Horseman | S01E06
Okay. I don't forgive you. | Herb Kazzaz | S01E08
I'm not gonna give you closure. You have to live with the shitty thing you did for the rest of your life. You have to know that it's never, ever going to be okay! | Herb Kazzaz | S01E08
I'm dying! I'm not gonna feel better! And I'm not gonna be your prop so you can feel better! | Herb Kazzaz | S01E08
I did fine. I had a good life. But what I needed then was... a friend. And you abandoned me. I will never forgive you for that. | Herb Kazzaz | S01E08
You know what your problem is? You want to think of yourself as the good guy. Well, I know you better than anyone, and I can tell you that you're not. In fact, you'd probably sleep a lot better at night if you just admitted to yourself that you're a selfish, goddamn coward who takes whatever he wants, and doesn't give a shit about who he hurts. That's you. That's BoJack Horseman. | Herb Kazzaz | S01E08
Yeah, I'm not seeing it. But that doesn't matter. Not everything's about me. And maybe I am a little jealous. Not because I actually want to date Princess Carolyn anymore... but just because I don't like the idea that I can't. I guess I just assumed I always could. But I made a lot of bad decisions. Not just with her, with everyone, really. | Bojack Horseman | S01E09
You know, sometimes I feel like I was born with a leak, and any goodness I started with just slowly spilled out of me, and now it's all gone. And I'll never get it back in me. It's too late. Life is a series of closing doors, isn't it? | Bojack Horseman | S01E09
I just keep getting pigeonholed as these complex characters in highly acclaimed movies. For once, I would just love to phone it in and play a two-dimensional girl in a rom com with no inner life of her own. That's kind of the reason I got into this business. | Naomi Watts | S01E10
Sometimes I just laugh after he talks, so he'll leave me alone. | Sarah Lynn | S01E11
You know, if we all had guns, then no one would need a gun, and we would all be safe. Oh my God, I think we just solved the gun crisis in America! | Bojack Horseman | S01E11
My question for you is, I am a good kid and I like to play and I like to go to school, but sometimes I get sad. What do you do when you get sad? How do you not be sad? | Bojack Horseman (as kid) | S01E12
When I was your age, I got sad. A lot. I didn't come from such a great home, but one day, I started running and that seemed to make sense, so then I just kept running. BoJack, when you get sad, you run straight ahead a-and you keep running forward, no matter what. There are people in your life who are gonna try to hold you back, slow you down, but you don't let them. Don't you stop running and don't you ever look behind you. There's nothing for you behind you. All that exists is what's ahead. | Secretariat | S01E12
It's not just you, you know. Your father and I, well... you come by it honestly, the ugliness inside of you. You were born broken, that's your birthright. And now you can fill your life with projects... your books and your movies and your little girlfriends, but it won't make you whole. You're BoJack Horseman. There's no cure for that. | Beatrice | S02E01
Your age of stagnation is when you stop growing. For most, it's when they get married, settle into a routine. You meet someone who loves you unconditionally and never challenges you or wants you to change, and then you never change. | Kelsey | S02E02
All I ever wanted was to be your friend... and you treat me like a big joke. You think I don't notice? Why don't you like me? | Mr. Peanutbutter | S02E08
I... want to feel good about myself... the way you do. And I don't know how. I don't know if I can. | Bojack Horseman | S02E08
This is the moment you realize something inside you is broken, and it can never be fixed. | Kelsey | S02E09
Well, why does anything matter, right? Love is an illusion, and happiness is fleeting, and there's no such thing as God, and all your favorite musicians beat their wives. Allegedly. | Diane Nguyen | S02E10
Listen to this guy, "clean it up later." He hasn't picked up his shit in years. | Bojack Horseman | S02E10
I can't be around someone who's just fuelled by bitterness and negativity. | Wanda | S02E10
I wish I could just go home right now and crawl into bed and not have to talk about anything or explain anything. He would just say, "How was your day?" And then he would say, "Hey, did you know the monorail was invented by George Monorail?" And I would say, "I don't think thats true." And he would say, "Well, if he didn't invent it, he certainly perfected it." And I wouldn't have to say "I'm sorry I left. I'm sorry I made things so difficult. I'm sorry I'm not the person I thought I was." I would just say, "My day was good." And he would say, "I love you." | Diane Nguyen | S02E10
Idea for a new app: an undo button that can undo long amounts of time. Three months. A year. A life. One click and everything could just go back to the way it was. | Diane Nguyen | S02E12
I'm not interested in being rebirthed, thank you. I'm still recovering from being birthed the first time. | Bojack Horseman | S03E01
All that matters now is the story. And we get to decide what our story is. Nobody else gets to tell you what your story is. | Ana | S03E01
An Oscar won't make you happy forever, it won't solve all your problems. You win that Oscar, the next day you go back to being you. But that night is a really good night. I think you deserve a really good night. | Ana | S03E01
Sometimes, you need to take responsibility for your own happiness. | Cuddlywhiskers | S03E03
I'm happy, for the first time in my life. And I'm not gonna feel bad about it. It takes a long time to realize how truly miserable you are, and even longer to see that it doesn't have to be that way. | Cuddlywhiskers | S03E03
I stand by my critique of Sartre. His philosophical arguments helped many tyrannical regimes justify overt cruelty. Also, the French smell and I hate them. | Bojack Horseman | S03E04
In this terrifying world, all we have are the connections that we make. I'm sorry I got you fired. I'm sorry I never called you after. | Bojack Horseman | S03E04
Nobody completes anybody. That's not a real thing. If you're lucky enough to find someone you can halfway tolerate, you sink your nails in and you don't let go. No matter what. | Bojack Horseman | S03E05
Yes. Exactly. Settle. Because otherwise you are just going to get older, and harder, and more alone. And you're going to do everything you can to fill that hole, with friends, and your career, and meaningless sex. But the hole doesn't get filled. And one day, you're gonna look around and you're gonna realize, that everybody loves you...but nobody likes you. And that is the loneliest feeling in the world. | Bojack Horseman | S03E05
They're adorable. Not that I value them based on their looks! Because, of course, children in society today are often reduced to their cuteness. I can't wait to get to know your children as people, so I can specifically compliment them individually on the foundation of their characters. | Diane Nguyen | S03E08
You gotta get me out of this thing. This asshole is giving me everything I ask for. What a nightmare. | Bojack Horseman | S03E08
Do you ever look up at the stars and feel like they're tiny holes in the sky, sucking out all the oxygen and suddenly you can't breathe because you're thinking about how small you are and meaningless it all is? | Captain Peanutbutter | S03E08
I do love you by the way, I mean as much as I'm capable of loving anyone, which is never enough. | Bojack Horseman | S03E09
Oh, great, of course! Here it comes! You can't keep doing this! You can't keep doing shitty things and then feel bad about yourself like that makes it okay! You need to be better! | Todd Chavez | S03E10
You are all the things that are wrong with you. It's not the alcohol, or the drugs, or any of the shitty things that happened to you in your career, or when you were a kid, it's you. Alright? It's you. | Todd Chavez | S03E10
Everything sucks! Especially sobriety. Why would I make my body a temple? I've been to temple. Temple is super-boring. | Sarah Lynn | S03E11
After I almost drowned, I decided I would never again be weaker than water. So I became a lifeguard. On my first day of training, my instructor told me that there are going to be times when you'll see someone in trouble. You're going to want to rush in there and do whatever you can to save them. But you have to stop yourself. Because there are some people you can't save. Because those people will thrash and struggle, and try to take you down with them. | Ana Spanikopita | S03E11
See? We're not doomed. In the great grand scheme of things, we're just tiny specks that will one day be forgotten. So it doesn't matter what we did in the past or how we'll be remembered, the only thing that matters is right now, this moment. This one spectacular moment we are sharing together. | Bojack Horseman | S03E11
I don't know how to be, Diane. It doesn't get better and it doesn't get easier. I can't keep lying to myself, saying that I'm going to change. I'm poison. | Bojack Horseman | S03E12
I come from poison. I have poison inside me, and I destroy everything I touch. That's my legacy. I have nothing to show for the life that I've lived, and I have nobody in my life who's better off for having known me. | Bojack Horseman | S03E12
I'm not gay. I mean, I don't think I am, but... I don't think I'm straight, either. I don't know what I am. I think I might be nothing. | Todd Chavez | S03E12
I wouldn't want to be my daughter either. | Bojack Horseman | S04E03
Welcome back, BoJack. It's good to see you. | Todd Chavez | S04E03
Piece of shit. Stupid piece of shit. You're a real stupid piece of shit. But I know I'm a piece of shit. That at least makes me better than all the pieces of shit who don't know they're pieces of shit. Or is it worse? | Bojack Horseman (to himself) | S04E06
Everyday, it gets a little easier. | Jogging Baboon | S02E12
Thank you for that lovely song. But, I'm not a good person. In fact, this is the only good thing I've ever done. And I did it by accident. And it just goes to show you, life is just....ah, what am I saying? I don't have to tell you how hard life is. You're the ones with the dead parents. | Bojack Horseman | S02E12
He knows you're terrible. He's the biggest idiot in the world and even HE knows you're terrible! | Bojack Horseman (to himself) | S04E06
Yeah. And it was great at first. But now I feel her getting attached, and I just know I'm gonna BoJack things up. | Bojack Horseman | S04E06
I don't know a lot about a lot of things! But I do know this: everybody deserves to be loved. | Mr. Peanutbutter | S04E06
If I'm shitty, that's just because I'm shitty. You're allowed to be mad at me, but you need to know that whatever I do, it's not your fault. | Bojack Horseman | S04E06
I know. I mean, I know, but I don't always know, you know? Like, sometimes I have this tiny voice in the back of my head that goes, like, "Hey, everyone hates you! And they're not wrong to feel that way!" | Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero-Robinson-Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack | S04E06
That voice, the one that tells you you're worthless and stupid and ugly? It goes away, right? It's just, like, a dumb teenage-girl thing, but then it goes away? | Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero-Robinson-Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack | S04E06
How did I not see it? All this time, I thought you were a terrible parent. And you were. But I blew it even worse. It turns out being a parent is... impossible.  |  Bojack Horseman | S04E10
Sartre was wrong. Physical pain is so much worse than prolonged emotional distress. What a hack! | Bojack Horseman | S05E05
My Dad died about ten years ago of injuries he sustained during a duel. When your father dies, you ask yourself a lot of questions. Questions like, "Wait, did you say he died in a duel?" and "Who dies in a duel?". The whole thing was so stupid. Dad spent his entire life writing this book, but he couldn't get any stores to carry it, or any newspapers to review it. Finally, I guess this one newspaper thought he was pretty hilarious, because they ran a review and tore him to shreds. So, my father, ever the Proud Mary, decides he would not stand for this besmirchment of his honor. He claimed the critic didn't understand what it meant to be a man, so he demanded satisfaction in the form of pistols at dawn. He wrote the paper this letter, saying anyone who didn't like his book, he would challenge to a duel, anyone in the world. He'd even pay for airfare to San Francisco and a night in a hotel. Well, eventually this found its way to some kook in Montana, who was a batshit as he was and took him up on the offer. They met at Golden Gate Park and agreed ten paces, then shoot. But in the middle of the ten paces, Dad turned to ask the guy if he's actually read the book and what he thought, but not looking where he was going, tripped over an exposed root and bashed his head on a rock. | Bojack Horseman | S05E06
The weird thing about both your parents being dead is it means that you're next. I mean, you know, obviously it's not like there's a wait list for dying. Any one of us could get run over by a Snapchatting teen at any moment. And you would think that knowing that would make us more adventurous, and kind, and forgiving. But it makes us small, and stupid, and petty. I actually had a near-death experience, recently. A stunt went bad and I fell off a building. I'm an actor. I do my own stunts. I'm on this new show, "Philbert". I'm Philbert. Star of the show. It hasn't come out yet, but it's already getting Emmy buzz. Oh, speaking of buzz [inhales, takes out a container of pills] I've to take two of these every morning, but my days are so screwed up 'cause of the shooting schedule, I don't even know what morning means anymore. There's a joke in there somewhere, about a guy who's been to so many funerals, he doesn't even know what mourning means anymore. Let you guys figure that one out for yourselves. [gulps down the pills] Anyway, you know what I thought when I was falling off the building and I went into panic mode? The last thing that my stupid brain could come up with before I died? "Won't they be sorry." Cool thought, brain. | Bojack Horseman | S05E06
You know what it's like? It's like that show Becker, you know, with Ted Danson? I watched the entire run of that show, hoping that it would get better, and it never did. It had all the right pieces, but it just-- it couldn't put them together. And when it got canceled, I was really bummed out, not because I liked the show, but because I knew it could be so much better, and now it never would be. And that's what losing a parent is like. It's like Becker. Suddenly, you realize you'll never have the good relationship you wanted, and as long as they were alive, even though you'd never admit it, part of you, the stupidest goddamn part of you, was still holding on to that chance. And you didn't even realize it until that chance went away. "My mother is dead, and everything is worse now." Because now I know I will never have a mother who looks at me from across the room and says, "BoJack Horseman, I see you." But I guess to good to know. It's good to know that there is nobody looking out for me, that there never was, and there never will be. No, it's good to know that I am the only one that I can depend on. And I know that now and it's good. It's good that I know that. So... it's good that my mother is dead. [gulps and then sighs] Well. No point beating a dead horse. Beatrice Horseman was born in 1938, and she died in 2018, and I have no idea... what she wanted. [beat] Unless she just wanted what we all want... to be seen.  | Bojack Horseman | S05E06
You know what your problem is? You hold everyone to an impossible standard, including yourself. It's super helpful for writing hot-take shakedowns, and clickbait take-downs, but totally toxic for your personal life and internalized sense of self-worth, girl. | Stefani | S05E12
But shouldn't we be asking more of ourselves - and of the people in our lives? | Diane Nguyen | S05E12
Of course. We all fail. The world is unforgiving enough as it is. The least we could do is find ways to forgive each other and ourselves. | Stefani | S05E12
It occured to me: Are my self destructive patterns and unexamined cycles of co-dependency the popular Jim Carrey character 'The Mask'? Because 'Somebody stop me!'. | Mr. Peanutbutter | S06E16
