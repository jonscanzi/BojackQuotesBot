"I Feel Like My Life Is Just A Series Of Unrelated Wacky Adventures."  |  Bojack Horseman   |  S00E00
"I Need To Go Take A Shower So I Can’t Tell If I’m Crying Or Not." |  Bojack Horseman   |  S00E00
"Ow, crap. I hate this. Running is terrible. Everything is the worst." |  Bojack Horseman   |  S00E00
"The universe is a cruel, uncaring void. The key to being happy isn’t the search for meaning; it’s just to keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense, and eventually, you’ll be dead."  |  Mr. Peanutbutter  |  S00E00
"I’m responsible for my own happiness? I can’t even be responsible for my own breakfast!"  |  Bojack Horseman  |   S01E01
"I don’t understand how people… live. It’s amazing to me that people wake up every morning and say: ‘Yeah, another day, let’s do it.’ How do people do it? I don’t know how."  |  Bojack Horseman  |   S00E00
I Need To Go Take A Shower So I Can’t Tell If I’m Crying Or Not | Bojack Horseman | S00E00
No, I don't think I should drive right now. I'm-I'm incredibly drunk. | Bojack Horseman | S01E01
You sleep on my couch and you don't pay rent. I've had tapeworms that are less parasitic. I don't even remember why I let you stay with me in the first place. | Bojack Horseman | S01E01
I don't know how you expect me to love you when you so clearly hate yourself. | Princess Carolyn | S01E01
You look like a pile of crap ate a second pile of crap and then crapped out a third pile of crap. | Princess Carolyn | S01E01
So, are you available for Tuesday, or are you gonna be too busy masturbating to old pictures of yourself? | Princess Carolyn | S01E01
Most people don't even get to do The Brady Bunch version of the thing they want to do with their lives. You're actually in a really good position now, because you can pretty much do anything you want. You're responsible for your own happiness, you know? | Diane Nguyen | S01E01
I just wanted you to know that you ruined someone else's night tonight. And I hope you have enough decency to at least feel a little bit crappy about it. | Bojack Horseman | S01E02
I was actually already in a bad mood but I thought maybe for one night, I could go out to a bar and try to forget about myself. But now because of you and your friends, I feel more self-conscious than ever. | Bojack Horseman | S01E02
Maybe because you're skinny and maybe 'cause you're pretty, you're used to getting away with things! But I want you to know that your actions have an effect on others, and I hate you! And you are a horrible person! And you not understanding that you're a horrible person doesn't make you less of a horrible person. | Bojack Horseman | S01E02
This is classic Hollywood elitism. BoJack Horseman thinks that because he was on TV, that makes him better than everybody. Well, guess what, BoJack! Now I'm on TV! So now I'm better than everybody! | Neal the Navy Seal | S01E02
Yes, I ate all the muffins, because I have no self-control and I hate myself. | Bojack Horseman | S01E02
Maybe some of the troops are heroes, but not automatically. I'm sure a lot of the troops are jerks. Most people are jerks already, and it's not like giving a jerk a gun and telling him it's okay to kill people suddenly turns that jerk into a hero. | Bojack Horseman | S01E02
And I don't believe saying that cheapens the word and actually disrespects those we mean to honor by turning real people into political pawns. Also, I am not deeply ambivalent about a seemingly mandated celebration of our military by a nation that claims to value peace telling our children that violence is never the answer while refusing to hold our own government to the same standard. Furthermore, I do not find it unbelievably appropriate that this conversation is taking place on reality television, a genre which thrives on chopping the complexities of our era into easily digestible chunks of empty catchphrases. | Bojack Horseman | S01E02
You know what the problem is with everybody? They all just want to hear what they already believe. No one ever wants to hear the truth. | Bojack Horseman | S01E02
The most important thing is, you got to give the people what they want, even if it kills you, even if it empties you out until there's nothing left to empty. No matter what happens, no matter how much it hurts, you don't stop dancing, and you don't stop smiling, and you give those people what they want. | Bojack Horseman | S01E03
Oh, come on! I mean, am I attracted to her? Sure. Do my days feel better when I'm around her? Yeah. Does she get me in ways no woman ever has? Indubitably. Do I fantasize about her? Yes, but only in two positions. Look, am I the kind of guy who would try to steal someone else's girlfriend? Sure, of course, but do I like her? The answer's no. You have nothing to worry about. | Bojack Horseman | S01E06
Okay. I don't forgive you. | Herb Kazzaz | S01E08
I'm not gonna give you closure. You have to live with the shitty thing you did for the rest of your life. You have to know that it's never, ever going to be okay! | Herb Kazzaz | S01E08
I'm dying! I'm not gonna feel better! And I'm not gonna be your prop so you can feel better! | Herb Kazzaz | S01E08
I did fine. I had a good life. But what I needed then was... a friend. And you abandoned me. I will never forgive you for that. | Herb Kazzaz | S01E08
You know what your problem is? You want to think of yourself as the good guy. Well, I know you better than anyone, and I can tell you that you're not. In fact, you'd probably sleep a lot better at night if you just admitted to yourself that you're a selfish, goddamn coward who takes whatever he wants, and doesn't give a shit about who he hurts. That's you. That's BoJack Horseman. | Herb Kazzaz | S01E08
Yeah, I'm not seeing it. But that doesn't matter. Not everything's about me. And maybe I am a little jealous. Not because I actually want to date Princess Carolyn anymore... but just because I don't like the idea that I can't. I guess I just assumed I always could. But I made a lot of bad decisions. Not just with her, with everyone, really. | Bojack Horseman | S01E09
You know, sometimes I feel like I was born with a leak, and any goodness I started with just slowly spilled out of me, and now it's all gone. And I'll never get it back in me. It's too late. Life is a series of closing doors, isn't it? | Bojack Horseman | S01E09
I just keep getting pigeonholed as these complex characters in highly acclaimed movies. For once, I would just love to phone it in and play a two-dimensional girl in a rom com with no inner life of her own. That's kind of the reason I got into this business. | Naomi Watts | S01E10
Sometimes I just laugh after he talks, so he'll leave me alone. | Sarah Lynn | S01E11
You know, if we all had guns, then no one would need a gun, and we would all be safe. Oh my God, I think we just solved the gun crisis in America! | Bojack Horseman | S01E11
My question for you is, I am a good kid and I like to play and I like to go to school, but sometimes I get sad. What do you do when you get sad? How do you not be sad? | Bojack Horseman (as kid) | S01E12
When I was your age, I got sad. A lot. I didn't come from such a great home, but one day, I started running and that seemed to make sense, so then I just kept running. BoJack, when you get sad, you run straight ahead a-and you keep running forward, no matter what. There are people in your life who are gonna try to hold you back, slow you down, but you don't let them. Don't you stop running and don't you ever look behind you. There's nothing for you behind you. All that exists is what's ahead. | Secretariat | S01E12
It's not just you, you know. Your father and I, well... you come by it honestly, the ugliness inside of you. You were born broken, that's your birthright. And now you can fill your life with projects... your books and your movies and your little girlfriends, but it won't make you whole. You're BoJack Horseman. There's no cure for that. | Beatrice | S02E01
